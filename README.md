## A simple operation system
A simple project for operation system class.  
Thanks to jyy.  
Original Project on: <https://github.com/NJUOS>

## NJUOS supports
* a simple bootloader to boot from the very beginning
* multi-threading, provides TCB for each thread
* sleep/wakeup
* lock/unlock and semaphore to protect critical area
* message reflection
* simple device drive for keyboard, serial output and terminal

## What will you see
* NJUOS needs qemu to boot
* NJUOS shows a simple terminal, the output is bound with the qemu terminal, and it echoes every letter you've typed when you press enter.

## What did I contribute to
* the whole multi-threading mechanism
* lock/unlock
* message reflection
